REPORT
- Come up with actual experiment to do and document
- Read up on DDPG and provide short explanation in report
- Explain how network construction works
- Report results
- Write conclusion

CODE
- Think up different network architectures and rewrite main script to try them all
- Aggregate and plot all results
- Comment code for better explanation
- Elaborate readme

OPTIONAL
- Add function to play lunarlander game with pretrained network
- Fix that the network can run on GPU (to do this, the dict containing the layers in the network classes
needs to be changed such that the layers are a direct attribute of the network classes --> construct dynamic variable names)
- Change network constructor such that activation function can be specified from config.json
