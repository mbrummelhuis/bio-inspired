Implementation and ablation study of the DDPG Reinforcement Learning algorithm for OpenAI gym's LunarLanderContinuous-v2 environment.

This is the git repository used for the assignment of the course AE4350 Bio-Inspired Intelligence and Learning for Aerospace Applications from the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology.
It follows an implementation of the DDPG paper by DeepMind, using the code from Phil Tabor (link his repo), along with some alterations I made myself for this assignment.
Below is an overview of the code structure and in short what I changed from mr. Tabor's code.

This file contains all the hyperparameters governing the neural network architecture and training.


CPU vs GPU implementation
Unfortunately, due to the dictionary-based building of the layers in the ActorNetwork and CriticNetwork classes, it is not possible to move the network reliably \
to the GPU, and therefore it is only possible to run the networks on the CPU. An interesting observation is that the CPU implementation seems to be quite a bit \
faster for smaller networks than the GPU implementation.
